# **Module 18, Challenge - building a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface**


Objective - to simulate fintech engineer working at a a major global bank. 

Scenario - As the lead developer of the decentralized finance team, build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

Product - 

>* Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.
>* Change the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute that’s of type Record. 
>* Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that you’ll store in the PyChain ledger. 
>* Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that you’ll store in the PyChain ledger.
